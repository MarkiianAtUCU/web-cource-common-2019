                    <p>
                        HTML is the World Wide Web’s core markup language. Originally, HTML was primarily designed as a language<br> for semantically describing scientific documents. Its general design, however, has enabled it to be adapted, over<br> the subsequent years, to describe a number of other types of documents and even applications.
                    </p>

                        This specification is intended for authors of documents and scripts that use the features defined in this specifica-<br>tion, ...

                    <li><h3>Scope</h3></li>

                    <em>This section is non-normative.</em>
                    <p>
                        This specification is limited to providing a semantic-level markup language and associated semantic-level script-<br>ing APIs for authoring accessible pages on the Web ranging from static documents to dynamic applications.
                    </p>

                    <li><h3>History</h3></li>

                    <em>This section is non-normative.</em>
                    <p>
                        For its first five years (1990-1995), HTML went through a number of revisions and experienced a number of ex-<br></br>tensions, primarily hosted first at CERN, and then at the IETF.
                    </p>

                    <li><h3>Design notes</h3></li>

                    <em>This section is non-normative.</em>
                    <p>
                        It must be admitted that many aspects of HTML appear at first glance to be nonsensical and inconsistent.
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><h4>Serializability of script execution</h4></li>

                        <em>This section is non-normative.</em>
                        <p>
                            To avoid exposing Web authors to the complexities of multithreading, the HTML and DOM APIs are designed<br> such that no script can ever detect the simultaneous execution of other scripts. Even with workers, the intent is<br> that the behavior of implementations can be thought of as completely serializing the execution of all<br> scripts in all browsing contexts.
                        </p>

                        <li><h4>Compliance with other specifications</h4></li>
                        <em>This section is non-normative.</em>
                        <p>
                            This specification interacts with and relies on a wide variety of other specifications. In certain circumstances, un-<br>fortunately, conflicting needs have led to this specification violating the requirements of these other specifica-<br>tions. Whenever this has occurred, the transgressions have each been noted as a <b>"willful violation"</b>, and the<br> reason for the violation has been noted.
                        </p>

                        <li><h4>Extensibility</h4></li>

                        <em>This section is non-normative.</em>
                        <p>
                            HTML has a wide array of extensibility mechanisms that can be used for adding semantics in a safe manner:
                        </p>
                        <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
                            <li><p>Authors can use the class attribute to extend elements, effectively creating their own elements, while using<br> the most applicable existing "real" HTML element, so that browsers and other tools that don’t know of the<br> extension can still support it somewhat well. This is the tack used by microformats, for example.</p></li>
                            <li><p>Authors can include data for inline client-side scripts or server-side site-wide scripts to process using the<br> data-*="" attributes. These are guaranteed to never be touched by browsers, and allow scripts to include<br> data on HTML elements that scripts can then look for and process.
                            <li><p>Authors can use the meta name="" content="" mechanism to include page-wide metadata by registering<br> extensions to the predefined set of metadata names.</p></li></p></li>
                            <li><p>Authors can use the rel="" mechanism to annotate links with specific meanings by registering extensions<br> to the predefined set of link types. This is also used by microformats.</p></li>
                        </ul>
                    </ol>

                    <li><h3>HTML vs XML Syntax</h3></li>

                    <em>This section is non-normative.</em>
                    <p>This specification defines an abstract language for describing documents and applications, and some APIs for<br> interacting with in-memory representations of resources that use this language.</p>

                    <li><h3>Structure of this specification</h3></li>

                    <em>This section is non-normative.</em>
                    <p>This specification is divided into the following major sections:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><h4><a href="#">Introduction</a></h4></li>
                        <p>Non-normative materials providing a context for the HTML specification.</p>

                        <li><h4><a href="#">Common infrastructure</a></h4></li>
                        <p>The conformance classes, algorithms, definitions, and the common underpinnings of the rest of the<br> specification.</p>

                        <li><h4><a href="#">Semantics, structure, and APIs of HTML documents</a></h4></li>
                        <p>Documents are built from elements. These elements form a tree using the DOM. This section defines the<br> features of this DOM, as well as introducing the features common to all elements, and the concepts used in defining<br> elements.</p>

                        <li><h4><a href="#">The elements of HTML</a></h4></li>
                        <p>Each element has a predefined meaning, which is explained in this section. Rules for authors on how to use<br> the element, along with user agent requirements for how to handle each element, are also given. This in-<br>cludes large signature features of HTML such as video playback and subtitles, form controls and form sub-<br>mission, and a 2D graphics API known as the HTML canvas.</p>

                        <li><h4><a href="#">User interaction</a></h4></li>
                        <p>HTML documents can provide a number of mechanisms for users to interact with and modify content, which<br> are described in this section, such as how focus works, and drag-and-drop.</p>
                    </ol>
                    <br>
                    <ol>
                        <li><h4>How to read this specification</h4></li>
                        <p>
                            This specification should be read like all other specifications. First, it should be read cover-to-cover, multiple<br> times. Then, it should be read backwards at least once. Then it should be read by picking random sections from<br> the contents list and following all the cross-references.
                        </p>

                        <div>
                            <h4>EXAMPLE 1</h4>
                            <p>For example, "the <code>foo</code> attribute’s value must be a <a href="#">"valid integer"</a> is a requirement on producers, as it lays out<br> the allowed values; in contrast, the requirement "the <code>foo</code> attribute’s value must be parsed using the <a href="#">rules for<br> parsing integers"</a> is a requirement on consumers, as it describes how to process the content.</p>
                        </div>

                        <b>Requirements on producers have no bearing whatsoever on consumers.</b>

                        <div>
                            <h4>EXAMPLE 2</h4>
                            <p>Continuing the above example, a requirement stating that a particular attribute’s value is constrained to being<br> a valid integer emphatically does not imply anything about the requirements on consumers. It might be that<br> the consumers are in fact required to treat the attribute as an opaque string, completely unaffected by<br> whether the value conforms to the requirements or not. It might be (as in the previous example) that the con-<br>sumers are required to parse the value using specific rules that define how invalid (non-numeric in this case)<br> values are to be processed.</p>
                        </div>
                    </ol>
